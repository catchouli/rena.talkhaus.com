A very large and tasty variety of cayenne chillis, these are great as a pizza topping, or to mellow out the flavor and heat profile of sauces. They're bright red and have a classic 'hot chilli' aesthetic, and are hotter than Jalapenos but less fleshy. I'd say they're a good alternative to Jalapenos for those reasons, but less good for pickling since they're not as chunky.
