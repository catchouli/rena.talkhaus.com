This movie was made as part of a 2 movie deal (along with Snake in the Eagle's Shadow) where Jackie Chan was lent to the studio, but this time he was actually credited as Jackie Chan. As suggested by the title, this one is actually about Drunken Boxing. We googled this to find out if it's a real style and apparently it actually has a long and real history, with various practitioners learning and rediscovering the style over hundreds of years. The specific style referenced in this movie is actually traced back to 1800s shaolin monks and based on the daoist tale of the drunken Eight Immortals. This movie uses a lot of the same actors as Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, and the same master teaches Jackie, but they're actually different characters and this time Beggar So is actually a drunken boxing master who's been hired to teach Jackie Chan his secret martial arts style by his father who is tired of his bad behavior. The fighting style actually involves drinking and there's some really fun scenes of Jackie drinking and acting drunk, and doing drunk kung-fu. There's also even more crispy deep fried music in this one, especially during high tension scenes, which is great. There's a number of classic scenes in this one including a big fight in a restaurant that Jackie tries to dine and dash at, where apparently the chef and all the staff are built AF. That's also where he meets beggar so. Basically this one is a classic.
