This is one of the more modern Jackie Chan films that's really worth watching. It's set in lawless 90s New York. Jackie moves there and immediately gets into a fight with a massive biker gang who then brutally chase and attack him. This also somehow gets him mixed up with brutal thugs who want to kill him, in classic Jackie Chan style. This movie has some good fights and a lot of property damage, and a crazy sequence at the end with a hovercraft chase through the city. Despite being set in New York it becomes clear as the movie goes on that it was actually filmed in Canada as Jackie decided they were spending too much effort trying to disguise it when nobody really cared. This one is pretty good and has a good story and although it's quite silly it's also pretty brutal at times.
