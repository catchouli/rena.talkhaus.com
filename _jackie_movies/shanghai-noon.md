A silly western-meets-chinese-martial-arts movie starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Jackie, an imperial guard from the forbidden city, travels to America to save the potentially kidnapped princess. On arrival he meets and somehow joins a tribe of native americans and is mistaken for one. He gets mixed up with Owen Wilson's cowboy character after a pretty cool action scene on a train. Seeing Jackie try to be a cowboy is pretty funny and although Owen Wilson is pretty annoying overall he makes a good stooge for Jackie. This movie is pretty funny and an interesting take and overall presentation. I didn't personally enjoy it overall as much as Jackie's older work as it's a bit overproduced and hollywoody for me and comes across as more of a family movie. It's not bad though.
