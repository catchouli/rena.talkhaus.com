A good sequel to Project A, I rate this one way higher than the first one but maybe I was unfair to it. A fun probably wrong fact about this movie is that Jackie wasn't going to make it but the Japanese emperor was a big fan of the first one and requested he did. In this one Jackie is put in charge of one of three of the district's police department and actually wants to do something to deal with some of the major criminals the corrupt police already know about but ignore or are getting kick backs from. The police are too scared to do anything about the organised crime so Jackie and his loyal gang try to arrest the ring leader themselves. This results in a  memorable battle and like Project A this one has some brutal looking falls. In fact this one has a lot of memorable action scenes, fights, and stunts, and the storytelling is way better than in the first one. At one point Jackie chews up a big hand full of hot chillies so he can use it to blind another guy and you can tell that he really did it. It's pretty good.
