This movie features Jackie a.k.a. 'Asian Hawk' as a rock star cross indiana jones style adventurer. The film starts with him stealing one piece of the 'Armour of Gods', a sword, which gets sold off at auction for big bucks. Then, his former bandmate's girlfriend gets kidnapped by an evil cult from yugoslavia, who demand that they bring three pieces of the armour of god as ransom. The film features more story and less fighting than other jackie Chan movies, but the action scenes are pretty good, and the story is overall pretty coherent. Jackie has a pretty sick concept sports car with a gigantic Mitsubishi logo on, and they probably sponsored this movie, but it's pretty cool and there's a great car chase scene later in the movie. A weird recurring theme from Police Story is that Jackie has lady troubles in this movie too. Overall this movie was pretty fun and I rate it maybe a little better than 'Who am I?', which is probably a worse movie overall but has some pretty kickass stunts and action scenes.
