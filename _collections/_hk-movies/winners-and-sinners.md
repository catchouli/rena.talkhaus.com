All three dragons (Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan) are present in this one but only Sammo has a starring role. This movie is actually one of the funniest things I've ever seen, and basically stars Sammo Hung as a guy who goes to jail and then gets out at the same time as 4 other inmates who all end up living in a house together. The five start a legit cleaning company but unfortunately get mixed up with a crime boss when they accidentally come into possession of a briefcase filled with his money. They're all basically dopes and play off each other and it's really funny and gets into trouble. One memorable scene has one of the five reading a manual on how to become invisible. The others realise this and pretend they can't see him which results in hilarity. Jackie and Biao play Hong Kong police offers (nope, not Ka kui) and have a pretty cool fight in the middle of the movie. The end comes together pretty well too and the movie actually has a pretty good ending. I really enjoyed this one and although it's not a 'main list Jackie Chan movie' it's still a classic and I'd recommend it.
