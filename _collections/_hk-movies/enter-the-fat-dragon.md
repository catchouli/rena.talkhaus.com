Jackie doesn't star in this one at all but it's a fun movie about a Sammo Hung who styles himself as a wannabe bruce lee. He moves to Hong Kong from the sticks to help out his family business but basically ends up wrecking it and getting involved with bad guys by fighting. Sammo is always hilarious and seeing him play off bruce lee, including against an actual bruce lee impersonator on a movie set, is pretty fun. Overall decent.
