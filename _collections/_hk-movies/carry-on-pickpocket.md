A movie starring Sammo Hung (aka Rice Pot) as a member of a pickpocketing team. He stars alongside Yuen Biao and Richard Ng (the moustache guy from the lucky stars franchise). We get to see them going about their pickpocketing which is pretty cool, and then they get mixed up in some gang business. Sammo gets an opportunity to fight and there's some pretty impressive fight-pickpocketing going on. Eventually there's a big showdown.

It's a pretty fun HK movie with a contemporary setting, and I enjoyed seeing the characters' pickpocketing skills. The fights in the middle of the movie are pretty fun and the end is fairly brutal. It's another movie where sooo much happens and I really enjoyed it.
