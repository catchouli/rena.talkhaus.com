One of the wackiest movies I've ever seen, this movie is somehow a bootleg street fighter movie, a time travel movie, and an asian teen comedy all in one. The movie features Lung (Ryu), Broom head (Guile), Ti-man (Vega/Balrog), and Sing (Dhalsim), who are the future cops! After fighting "The General" (M.Bison/Vega)'s cronies Kent (Ken), Thai King (Sagat), and Toyota (E.Honda, lol) in 2043, they have to travel back in time from 2043 to 1993 in order to stop the general's men from killing (in the past) the judge who sentenced the general to prison. The movie starts off with a big fight between the future cops and the general's men, before they use the time machine to escape into the past. The rest of the movie is just wacky humor as the future cops arrive in the past and have to infiltrate a school to find the judge and protect him. This movie reminds me of Jackie Chan's craziest movie City Hunter, except even more unhinged, and it's like if the whole movie was the street fighter scene. By the climax of the movie, the rest of the street fighter gang have accumulated and there's a big showdown, including other popular manga characters from the era, including some amazing ones. I see this one being pretty polarising but I laughed a lot and if you like cheesy bootleg comedy movies it's great.
