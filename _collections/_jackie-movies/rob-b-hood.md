Jackie is a professional burglar who gets mixed up in the kidnapping of a baby. The majority of this movie is Thongs (Jackie) and his close friend and fellow burglar Octopus learning to look after a baby and eventually bonding with it which is actually pretty funny and fun to watch. Additionally there's guys trying to take the baby off them which results in some funny action and a car chase. A fun game is to try and spot mitsubishi logos in these movies and we spotted a few in these scenes but we aren't really sure if mitsubishi cars are just popular in Hong Kong or if he's still sponsored by them from back in the Armour of God days (Mitsubishi shows up a lot). For a modern Chan movie I enjoyed this one more than I expected given the name.
