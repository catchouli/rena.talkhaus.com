This one was somehow made around the same time as Drunken Master 2, wow Jackie Chan is a busy man. Basically it's nothing like any of his other movies. For one, it's a manga adaptation, and it really shows. The whole movie is like live action anime, and it's incredible. We laughed for a solid 2 hours, and the movie got even more absurd and hilarious as it went on. This film is known for its classic street fighter 2 sequence, which was probably my favorite part, but outside of that nobody ever seemed to recommend this one to me, which is a shame because it's hilarious and amazing. There's three main female characters and they're all pretty fun characters with some good fights and funny scenes. It also features a musical number, multiple large scale fight scenes, some amazing quotes, and Jackie Chan skateboarding. It also stars Bruce Lee... sorta :). This whole movie could be described as 'hilarious anime-style antics with Jackie Chan' which I honestly dig the hell out of. It's super slapstick and absurd but it's also probably one of the best films I've ever watched, I don't think I've laughed this much in years.
