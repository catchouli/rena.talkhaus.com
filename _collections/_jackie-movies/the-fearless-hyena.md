A solid martial arts movie with a classic Jackie Chan spin on it. In this movie, Jackie lives with his aged granda and kung fu master, who insists that he must keep his kung fu skills secret. Jackie basically just messes around a lot and gets Eventually Jackie gets a job working at a kung fu dojo run by a guy who doesn't know any kung fu, and basically just wants Jackie to impress everyone with fights so that they join his dojo Jackie ends up pretending to be a number of different characters in some great and funny fights including a chopsticks duel, a fight disguised as a woman which reminded me of the Chun-Li scene in City Hunter, and a drunken boxing match. Eventually showing off his kung fu goes wrong, oh no who would've thought! This one has the highest frequency of fights in any Jackie Chan movie I've seen and they're all damn good. It's solid.
