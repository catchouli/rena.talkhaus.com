Police Story 2 features Chan Ka-kui from the first movie but now he's been demoted due to his reckless handling of the case from the previous movie. Initially this seems like he won't get into as much trouble now but he ends up finding out that the villain from the first movie has been released from prison because he's critically ill and Ka-kui and his girlfriend start getting followed and attacked by the guy's thuggish lawyer. After saving the day as a civillian he's reinstated and drafted into solving a new case possibly linked to the same guy. There's some brutal scenes in this one and it's easily worth watching but I didn't think it was as good as the first one, but there's a big fight in a fireworks factory at the end which is pretty kickass. Overall I really enjoyed it.
