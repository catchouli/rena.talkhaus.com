Classic Jackie Chan movie. It's a spy movie kind of thing where Jackie loses his memory, and while trying to find out who he is and what's going on, the big bad guy is sending a bunch of guys after him to get him. Which results in a bunch of cool fights and comedy action scenes. Overall it's not the best Jackie Chan movie I've seen and the start might make you think it's kind of dumb and not worth watching but the rest of the movie is full of hilarious and memorable action scenes including a car chase with a Jackie Chan twist, rooftop parkour, an epic 2v1 rooftop fight and numerous other grandiose Jackie Chan stunts which all make it well worth watching. As a sidenote Jackie was one of the directors of this movie which is probably why he got to do so many stupid stunts (which in the outtakes you can tell are all legit.)
