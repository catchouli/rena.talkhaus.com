Buck Yuen (Jackie Chan), orphan and badass gym equipment salesman, saves the day when armed bank robbers attack a bank in the mall where he works. The resulting media attention gets him noticed by a private eye who is working with a dying man who is allegedly his father. When he goes to meet his father he finds him being attacked by armed men and defends him from them using medical equipment, eventually being left a quest to find his inheritance. This inevitably embroils him with spies, terrorist groups, and the enemies of his father. This movie has some notable scenes, including Jackie fighting his way naked through an outdoor market in a hilarious sequence of unlikely events, and a speed-like sequence at the end. Additionally this movie is, according to our head-canon, a sequel to both who am I and city hunter. Despite the notable moments this movie is a bit lacking in good fight scenes, comedy, and stunts, and takes itself a bit too seriously, resulting in the low score, but it's probably worth watching if you're a fan of Jackie Chan.
[btw our headcanon is that he becomes a spy after this movie, and then at the start of who am i loses his memory, and then at the end of who am i he finds a city hunter manga and decides to move to japan to become ryu saeda, private detective]
