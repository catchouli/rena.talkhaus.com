A sequel to armour of god but it doesn't have the armour of god in it. Instead, it's about nazi gold, and Jackie has to adventure through the desert with three women kind of like the first one. Jackie gets a percentage of the 2400 tons of nazi gold if he finds it and reclaims it for the U.N. It's pretty enjoyable, about as good as the original movie, I'd maybe have scored it a bit less but the scenes near the end where they fight in the wind tunnel in the underground nazi bunker really make it. There's a number of visible mitsubishi badges in this one too so I guess he's still sponsored by them. A fun fact about this one is that it was actually released first in the English Speaking world as Operation Condor, and then Armour of God was actually released as Operation Condor 2, which is unnecessary and confusing. In conclusion it's a worthwhile sequel to the first movie and well worth watching.
