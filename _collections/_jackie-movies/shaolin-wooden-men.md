I thought this one was going to be bad because of the terrible attempt at a name, but it's actually pretty good. Jackie's character grows up in a shaolin monastery as a mute monk. He's made fun of for his muteness and considered the weakest one there, but one day he meets a guy locked up in a dungeon who teaches him his special vicious style of kung fu. He also learns a bit of drunken boxing and more peaceful versions of kung fu from other shaolin masters. Eventually he challenges the Wooden Men Road, a brutal challenge that the trainees have to do before they can graduate and be allowed to leave the monastery. This movie reminds me of dragon ball, with the shaolin kung fu training, and it has a lot of raw kung fu fights too, I bet Toriyama saw this one. Also it has wooden robots which are pretty cool. It's pretty fun and tells a solid story for one of these old movies. Oh and I forgot to mention it has the most ridiculously crispy high pitch chinese flute music that plays during key scenes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SztxVmlO4t8
