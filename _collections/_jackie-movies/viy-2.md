A weird Russian fantasy film which bizarrely features Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger. We expected it to be bad on the level of Bleeding Steel since it's so modern but it's actually pretty good. It's worth noting that it's debatable whether this one even counts as a Jackie Chan movie since he's mostly on the sidelines. The storytelling and acting are a bit dopey, but overall this was a cool fantasy adventure movie with lots of great worldbuilding and visuals. Especially we found that some of the 'boss' characters were really cool and well designed. At one point Jackie and Arnold fight in a prison escape sequence which I'm pretty sure hasn't happened in any other movie. This one got panned by critics which I'm not surprised about but it's kind of unfair because it's a really unique movie that's probably worth watching if you like quirky fantasy fiction. Jj
