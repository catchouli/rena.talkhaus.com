In this one Dragon Lung, played by Jackie Chan, and his brother, are both orphans and members of a kung fu school where they live. The school enters into a Lion Dance competition, where two people in each dragon somehow battle to win. The rules of the competition aren't clear but it's a really cool scene anyway. This eventually results in Dragon being chased by both a big bad guy and the police chief, for something he didn't do. The rest of the movie is basically Jackie trying to go about his day but constantly getting into trouble and having to fight. There's a lot of fights in this movie and they're all original and interesting. The scenes where Jackie is trying to escape capture are all pretty whimsical. At some point in this movie somebody tells jackie he's been "working on his benchwork" which we've been referring to ever since as any fighting with those old chinese benches they fight with or any fight with a chair. Basically it's classic Jackie Chan where he's just going about his day and everyone wants to kill him due to a misunderstanding. The final fight is brutal.
