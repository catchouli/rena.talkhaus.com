A spiritual prequel to the Drunken Master films starring a young Jackie Chan and the same distinctive and hilarious drunken master beggar so. To be honest we found this on youtube at 20 minutes past midnight and "Jackie Chan" isn't even credited, but we found out later that this was his break-out role along with Drunken Master. And I can see why too, it's a real classic among HK action-comedy martial arts films. The movie starts out with the second-last practitioner of the "snake style" of kung fu being killed by a master practitioner and assassin of the "eagle style" who are trying to wipe them out. Jackie gets caught up in this and learns the snake style, eventually making it his own (which is honestly hilarious too). The film is full of great fights and comedy and the music is super crispy which is a necessity for classic hong kong martial arts movies. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and it ignited a passion in me for classic martial arts comedy movies, so I rate it way higher than Who Am I.
