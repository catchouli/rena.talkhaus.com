A fairly solid third entry in the Police Story series. Jackie reprises his role as Chan Ka Kui for the last time in this one, where he's undercover working for the Chinese government to infiltrate a notorious criminal organisation. There's some funny mixups and some dangerous looking stunts, one of which in particular injured Jackie pretty bad if you watch the outtakes. This one isn't as much of a classic as the first two police story movies but still well worth watching.
