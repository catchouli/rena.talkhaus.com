Jackie is back at it again in another Police Story movie. It's really hard to find this one in its original 1 hour 40+ minute hong kong cut, instead we watched the 1 hour 20 version that ended up on blu-ray, which was originally the American version I think. Despite this it was pretty good. Hopefully the original hk cut ends up on blu-ray at some point and then we can watch it again.

Jackie (yes, he's called that in this movie for some reason) is transferred from the Hong Kong police to help the CIA out with a smuggling operation, which ends him up in Ukraine. He's meant to do a really simple job and then just go on vacation, which he completes almost immediately, but then before catching his flight out of Ukraine he spots the guy they're supposed to be finding being susp af and follows him to a ski resort. Some pretty sick action and a chase scene occurs. Somehow Jackie eventually ends up in Australia and swimming with sharks in an aquarium too.

My one criticism of this is that it's not really a police story movie - he doesn't play Chan Ka Kui in this movie, and it's really nothing like the other (main line) police story movies like we expected, although it does have the police chief in it as Jackie's police chief. In fact, in some regions, it was just called "Jackie Chan's First Strike". Despite this, it's a very fun Jackie Chan movie, where he gets into much mischief he doesn't want anything to do with, and has to fight a bunch of guys and save the day.
