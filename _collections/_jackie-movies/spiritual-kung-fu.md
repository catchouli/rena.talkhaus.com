A classic Kung Fu movie with some twists, this one is a really solid early Jackie Chan movie. It's more serious than some of his later films and he hadn't developed his comedic fighting style yet but there's still a lot of humour to be found elsewhere in the movie. Jackie plays a young apprentice at a shaolin temple, and one day the seven deadly fists fighting style manual is stolen. An evil guy learns the horrible style (that the shaolin haven't taught in over 100 years) and goes around killing all the best martial artists so he can be crowned leader of the martial arts community. Spiritual apparitions appear in the temple which really scares the shit out of all the monks but Jackie ends up rediscovering the long lost five fists style which is the counter to the other style. The spirits are pretty crazy looking and funny and made me feel like I was tripping when they suddenly showed up. It's a really fun movie and pretty different and weird. The reconstructed Blu-ray release is beautiful too and really shows off the high quality cinematography. It's a classic.
