Another fun dragons movie, in this one Jackie plays a lawyer representing some businessman who's polluting the water with his factory. A woman who owns a fishery downstream is suing him and wants him to shut down production. Jackie drags in Biao, who plays an eccentric and slightly crazy thief guy, to break into her house and plant a bug. Meanwhile, Sammo Hung moves in next to her in an attempt to woo her and get her to voluntarily sell the fishery, for which he'll take a cut. There are some mixups and Sammo and Biao end up fighting in Jackie's house while he tries to have a date with the daughter of the owner of the fishery. In the end Sammo really falls in love with the fishery lady and Jackie with the daughter and there's all sorts of misunderstandings and funny interactions between them. There's a big show down at the end involving the baby man from Wheels on Meals but this time he has some pretty intense eyeliner to make his deep set eyes look even crazier. This is a really good film.
