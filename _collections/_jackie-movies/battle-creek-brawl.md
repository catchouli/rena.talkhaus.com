Set in 1930s Chicago, Jackie plays the son of an owner of a Chinese restaurant who refuses to pay protection money to the mob. Jackie is a solid fighter and fights them off repeatedly which causes them to want to draft him into a street fighting circuit called The battle Creek Brawl. The mob end up kidnapping his brother's girlfriend to force him to participate and then he beats the shit out of a bunch of massive muscly american fighter guys. Fighting ring but it seems to be an official event with thousands of spectators including police. Regardless, it's pretty damn cool. The scene also sports a number of other memorable scenes including three person roller skating relay race with no holds barred. Solid movie with an interesting setting.
