A bit of a different movie starring Sammo Hung (one of the 'dragons' who stars alongside and even directs a number of Jackie's movies including this one) as Jackie's mentally disabled older brother. Heart of Dragon is more emotional and character based and includes some stellar acting from Sammo and Jackie. Despite being more of a serious movie I still really enjoyed it and got seriously invested in Sammo's character and his world, making this one of my favourite Jackie Chan movies. There's some decent action too and even a car chase and some humour, and none of it detracts from the overall tone of the movie. Overall I really recommend this one.
