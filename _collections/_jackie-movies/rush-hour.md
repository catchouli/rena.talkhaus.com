Rush Hour is one of the few Jackie Chan movies I've actually seen before and I didn't expect to like it that much since it's pretty representative of Jackie's transition to Hollywood productions. Despite that it holds up pretty well and the Hollywood production doesn't ruin it. It's funny, has decent action scenes, and Chris Tucker isn't even too annoying and is another good stooge for Jackie. My favorite part of the movie is when Chris Tucker's character is asked to keep Jackie away and out of trouble, and Jackie goes out of his way to escape him and break his way into the fbi-controlled building he was supposed to be kept away from. It's a funny movie in a different way to Jackie's earlier films and it isn't too overproduced, so it gets a thumbs up from me.
