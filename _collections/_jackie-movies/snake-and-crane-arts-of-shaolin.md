This one is pretty cool. Jackie Chan plays a martial artist who's been charged with looking after the Eight Steps of Snake and Crane book of the previously disappeared shaolin masters. He shows this book off a suspicious amount given that he's trying to keep it safe and fights anyone that tries to take it. There's various factions who are either with Jackie or against him but everyone basically wants this book for one reason or another and Jackie won't even let them look inside. It's more serious than some of his other films but it's a good martial arts movie and features some female martial artists.
