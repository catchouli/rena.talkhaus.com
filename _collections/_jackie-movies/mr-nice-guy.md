Apparently Jackie Chan's first film shot in English, and directed by Samo Hung, and a member of the Three Dragons along with Jackie. The dialogue in this one is a little goofy and reminds me of when they have English speaking parts in his earlier Chinese movies but a bit less so. Jackie gets mixed up in gang violence and his girlfriend gets kidnapped, pretty normal Jackie Chan affair. There's some non-English parts which are funny (usually to do with Jackie's other friend not understanding the Chinese). Some of the locations are really neat, and there's lots of decent fight choreography and a fantastic end scene with a lot of destruction. It comes across as a little more mainstream but I rate it up there with Who Am I.
