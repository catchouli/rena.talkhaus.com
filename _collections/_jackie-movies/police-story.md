Jackie Chan plays inspector Chan Ka-Kui of the Honk Kong police force's special ops unit. In this movie he's tasked with bringing a drug dealer and possible hitman crimelord to justice, who bizarrely keeps getting away with saying 'you didn't see me do it!' which makes him the most impossible guy ever for the police to catch. Joking aside, the opening starts with some great and comedic action, and famously follows with Jackie hanging from a moving bus using an umbrella while the crims try desparately to knock him off. Jackie has a lot of trouble with women in this movie, and his day just keeps getting worse throughout the movie in hilarious ways. There's a bunch of tension and the action scenes in this movie are kickass and hilarious; it also uses so much stunt glass that the crew jokingly referred to it as 'Glass Story'. Overall this is classic Jackie Chan at his best.
