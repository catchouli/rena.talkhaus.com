Another kinda terrible movie from the era past which it seems Jackie can't really do much fighting or stunts anymore. That'd be fine if this movie had any of the charm of his old movies though. This one is really average at everything and comes across as a generic low budget action shooter film with pointless cameos from Jackie Chan. We stayed with it through what we thought was the final scene of the movie, but then we realised there was still another hour left and finally gave up on it. Pointless movie with tons of bad gun play and corny, boring storytelling.
