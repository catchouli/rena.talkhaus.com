Terrible, long, boring, and offensive in places. It's a terrible movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it. It starts off kind of cool with a visually interesting villain and a cool cyberpunk theme but the next 30 minutes of the film made me feel bad for kind of getting into it at the beginning. It feels like a youtube movie, the cuts in action scenes make it hard to tell what's going on, and the music is terrible and mixed far too loud. All this movie does is mix popular sci-fi elements with a bad family movie plot and it doesn't even make sense. The cyberpunk elements are restricted purely to the related villain characters and the rest of the world is just completely normal and boring, and the movie presents overall like a coming of age love story. Not even Jackie can make this movie watchable, and we didn't even finish it.
