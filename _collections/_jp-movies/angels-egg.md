A beautiful and bizarre gothic art film created by Mamoru Oshii, the director of Ghost in the Shell, and Yoshitaka Amano, known for Final Fantasy's concept art. The film is visually stunning and contains almost no dialogue, and depicts a gothic dark-souls esque world ripe for interpretation. Every scene is fascinating and I spent the whole movie with my eyes locked to the screen absorbing the ambience. This film does a fantastic job creating a world completely different to ours and reminds me strongly of the fascination I felt discovering fiction as a child. Overall it seems like an under-appreciated masterpiece and it's probably one I'll continue to revisit.
