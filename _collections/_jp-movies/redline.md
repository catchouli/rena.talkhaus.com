An amazing animated racing movie set in space, Redline is a visual spectacle from start to end. The racing is insane and reminds me of pod racing but on the finest japanese crack. The final race is set on a planet of space cyber nazis that are intent to destroy the race and racers at any cost, but thanks to crazy racers and fourth dimensional super technological magical girls the race goes ahead anyway. An absurd and enjoyable movie that's worth a watch or two for the visual spectacle alone.
