A live action art house movie by Anno Hideaki, the creator of Neon Genesis Evangelion, this movie astounded me when we originally watched it (by accident, thinking it was a horror movie because of the English name). The movie follows a young filmmaker who meets an odd girl who lives in an abandoned office building and every day says 'tommorow is my birthday'. The film's cinematography features many interesting industrial locations and unusual, artsy shots which reflect the characters' psyches. A fascinating experience overall.
