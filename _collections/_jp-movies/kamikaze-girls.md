A light-hearted comedy girl that features the unlikely meeting and budding friendship of a yankee girl and a lolita girl. The film has a highly absurd and anime-esque aesthetic that's highly enjoyable, with many fluffy, comic-book style visuals. Overall really heartwarming, and funny, if in a corny way that I tend to enjoy.
