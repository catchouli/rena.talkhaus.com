Probably my favorite super hot chilli I've tried so far and has an interesting history. Naga chillies are native to Bangladesh and northeast India, and was until recently the hottest chilli in the world, although it now has a number of contenders. This chilli was discovered by people outside India and Bangaledesh in the early 2000s, although even before then it was likely in use locally prior to that. This chilli has a much 'darker' and rich flavor when compared to the fruity flavors of bonnets or even reapers, and when I tasted it I thought 'this tastes of death, but in an interesting way'. I've grown to like these chillies a lot and they've become our favorite for making sauce, where we often combine them with other chillies to make a more mellow, tasty sauce. The naga chilli is highly recommended.
