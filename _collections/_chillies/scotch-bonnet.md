A classic hot and sweet variety from the Carribean. This is the first really hot kind of chilli I tried since they're fairly available in the UK, and it has a distinct sweet, fruity flavor which makes it ideal for flavoring spicy Asian food. It's also responsible for the unique flavor of Jamaiacan jerk chicken and other Carribean dishes. I highly recommend this one to any chilli lover.
