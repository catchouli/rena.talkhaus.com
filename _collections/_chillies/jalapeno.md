The classic mexican pepper. Jalapenos are chunky, with firm, smooth flesh, and are often used for pickling, or smoked to produce chipotle peppers. They can also be used for many other things including stuffing to make jalapeno poppers, which are often made with larger varieties of jalapenos. If you get them in the store they're often green, but Jalapenos actually ripen to a bright red color, and I'd guess they pick them early in order to produce more chillies. However if you get to try fully ripe jalapenos they're intensely sweet and it's quite a different experience to the green ones, and imo enhances them greatly. Very available and pretty tasty, but not very hot.
