Another reasonably hot chilli with about the same scoville rating as the Scotch bonnet, but with a more floral and slightly less sweet flavor than the scotch bonnet. I rate this one a little lower than the scotch bonnet since it's in the same heat range but less hot, but it's a very tasty alternative. The distinct sweet flavor is great for hot sauces, of which <a href="/chillies/sauces.html">we've made a few</a>. This one is also highly recommended.
