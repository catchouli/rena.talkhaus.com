One of the most well known superhots and currently recognized as the hottest chilli pepper in the world by Guinness. Despite looking like a wrinkly devil's asshole carolina reapers are actually surprisingly fruity and sweet, and have a distinct flavor which reminds me of rich tomatoes. They're also intensely hot and will kick your butt and give you a massive adrenaline hit if you aren't used to eating super hots. Often available dried or as a powder, carolina reapers are great for chillis as the rich fruity tomato flavor really enhances them, and the intense heat means that you don't need more than a couple for a whole pot of chilli.
