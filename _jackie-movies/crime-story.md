Crime Story once again features Jackie Chan as a hong kong cop, but unfortunately it's not Ka Kui from Police Story. This movie is more of a serious one and was apparently based on the actual 1990 kidnapping of a Chinese businessman, Teddy Wang. Unlike most of his movies in this one Jackie actually loves using guns and shooting everyone, and thus definitively answers the question 'does Jackie Chan ever use a gun?' (although we've noted other instances in previous films we've watched this one is the most blatant case). This movie has some good dramatic acting from Jackie as well as a bunch of great action scenes, property damage, and explosions. Interestinlgy it has 93% on the tomatometer which is way higher than I'd expect since a lot of his older movies that I'd consider classics have much less than that, but it's still well worth watching if you're in the mood for a more serious Jackie Chan movie.
