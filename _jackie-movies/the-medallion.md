A more Hollywood style Jackie Chan movie, this one is just about watchable. In this film Jackie plays a Hong Kong cop (for the 50th time and it isn't kakui from police story) and somehow crosses paths with a magic talisman that can bring back the dead and grant superpowers. This happens to Chan and although that sounds like a cool premise for a movie they don't really use Jackie to even a fraction of his potential. There's barely any fights and all the action scenes are choppy with confusing framing and cuts all over the place. By the final fight of the movie I was pretty bored and wasn't really paying much attention. The film resembles the cartoon Jackie Chan adventures and the villain is even played by the voice actor of the villain Valmont from the cartoon. Overall it's more worth watching than Bleeding Steel but I'd still pass.
