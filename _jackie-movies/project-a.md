Jackie Chan is a coast guard man in pirate times in old Hong Kong. It's got some interesting worldbuilding with the military stuff and the tensions between the coast guard and the military police results in some funny tension. Bizzarely the bicycle choreography is surprisingly good with a lot of funny and enjoyable bicycle based action. There's also a fight in a clock tower and a famous fall from it that almost broke Jackie's head. All the coast guard stuff becomes irrelevant for most of the movie and somehow they bring it back around to the pirates at the end but tbh the story doesn't make a lot of sense. Probably not the best mainly because of how non sequitur it is but I thought it was ok.
