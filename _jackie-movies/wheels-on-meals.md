This movie stars the Jackie's three man gang the dragons (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao). Jackie and Biao run a food van as a duo and Sammo is a private detective who gets offered a big job to find an orphan girl. Coincidentally, around the same time, Jackie and Biao also get involved with a girl who they try and help out of the trouble she's in. The action (between the dragons especially) is very funny and the dialogue noticeably so, and there's some notable fight scenes. Of specific mention is one near the end of a henchman with deep set eyes that make his face look really small, who we've been calling 'baby man' because he also has superbly smooth skin. He also stars in other Jackie Chan films and makes us laugh every time he's on screen, as well as being an actual fighting badass. I really enjoyed and recommend this movie and want to check out more of the dragons' work after watching it.
