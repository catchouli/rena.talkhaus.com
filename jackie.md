I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan and have watched a ton of his movies. Any movie with Jackie Chan or his co-stars Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao is pretty much gold as long as it was made before ~2000. I've written notes on them as I've watched them and given them a score out of 10, so here's my ranking chart of Jackie Chan movies.
